Bug bounty scripts

I'm by no menas a developer so the code will be ugly, but it's the best I got and I'm sure I'll get better over time. These are my bug bounty scripts, and with that my journy to getting better at finding bugs. As background I started getting interested in CTFs in the spring of 2019 but lacked time. In the summer of 2019 I started looking more at bug bounty as a parallell path. Some of the code is written by me, but much of it will use function or even be partly built of other people's script they have published. My goal is of cource to give cred whereever I can but no one's perfect so if I missed it any where please ping me about it!

I'm a fiddler with a bachlor degree in network engineering who tries to understand how the world works. Feel free to be part of my journey, also, feel free to make changes, not only by helping me with the code but also by providing tips and directions you find fitting.

Cheers,
Zev
